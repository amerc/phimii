INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'CLK_IN', used in period specification 'TS_CLK',
   was traced into DCM_SP instance dcm_sp_inst. The following new TNM groups and
   period specifications were generated at the DCM_SP output(s): 
   CLKFX: <TIMESPEC TS_clkfx = PERIOD "clkfx" TS_CLK / 0.25 HIGH 50%
   INPUT_JITTER 50 ps>
